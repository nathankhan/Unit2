	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p>I am inspired by <a href= www.nowness.com>NOWNESS</a> and <a href= www.repossi.com>repossi</a></p>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, of balance?</h2>
	<p>I've found that both of these sites untilize the positive space with picture content that draws my focus. The little negative space that is used is where the site content is held. I also liked how prominent the pictures were in the positive space, very eye catching.</p>


	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>Both of these sites display pictures in the positive space and clickable content in the negative space, which directs the user around the page. The nowness.com site is a bit different because uses changing grids and colums to display its content. </p>

	<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Thumbnail 1</strong></li>
			<img src="images/thumbnail_1.png">
			<p>In the above main page im looking to draw focus to the two pictures that would take up most of the positive space on the page, the two pictures would bring balance to the landscape then shift the focus to the text</p>
		<li><strong>Thumbnail 2</strong></li>
